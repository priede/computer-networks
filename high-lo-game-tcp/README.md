# Programming Project 2 -  Simple Client-Server Game of Hi Low (using TCP sockets and Java) #
In this project, you will be modifying your program from the last programming project to use the following:

(1) TCP Sockets

(2) Serialized Objects (that is, use only Serialized Object data from client to server and vice-versa).

This should be straight forward and should expose you to how applications use network protocols. Later, we will investigate the internal workings of TCP.
